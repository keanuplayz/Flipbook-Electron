# Flipbook-Electron
An Electron port of the CCDirectLink tool "Flipbook"

## Installing
1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/keanuplayz/Flipbook-Electron/releases)
2. Download the release.
3. Execute the .exe

## Building
1. Download the source code.
2. Extract the source to an empty directory.
3. In the extracted directory, run `yarn dist` (to package in a distributable format (e.g. dmg, windows installer, deb package)) or `yarn pack` (only generates the package directory without really packaging it. This is useful for testing purposes).

## Notices
I am not associated with Radical Fish Games, the code here may rely on but should not contain code from CrossCode.

The main code is from the [Flipbook Repository](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/flipbook) and is developed by [omegalink12](https://github.com/omegalink12).

I did not create Flipbook, nor did I help creating it.
